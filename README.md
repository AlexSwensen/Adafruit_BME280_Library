This is a library for the Adafruit BME280 Humidity, Barometric Pressure + Temp sensor

Particle Photon & Core DHT Library based on Arduino Library for BME280 sensors adapted by Markus Haack

v1.0.0, September 2015 Initial Release
v1.1.0, October 2015 pull from Adafruit repo to support multiple sensors with different calibration values

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit BME280 Breakout
